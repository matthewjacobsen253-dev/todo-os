There are five directions ranging from evolutionary (keeping elements of the current mark) to revolutionary (completely new identity).\n\nI've uploaded them to the shared Figma workspace under \"Cobalt Rebrand > Logo Concepts R1\". Each concept includes:\n- Primary logo\n- Icon mark\n- Wordmark variation\n- Color applications\n\nWould love to schedule a review session this week if possible. Let me know what works for your team.\n\nBest,\nFatima",
